double SUTrace(const SU_vector&,const SU_vector&);

///\brief A vector represented in the SU(n) basis
///
/// An object in SU(n) has n^2 components. By default SU_vector will
/// automatically allocate sufficient 'backing storage' to contain
/// these. It is, however, possible to specify that an SU_vector
/// should treat some externally provided buffer as its backing
/// storage. In this case the size and lifetime of that buffer are
/// the resposibility of the user, so users are encouraged to avoid
/// using this mode unless it is required by their application, as
/// its use is more difficult and requires much greater care.
/// The external storage mode is primarily useful because it allows
/// interfacing with other, low-level numerical codes efficiently.
///
/// SU_vector provides overloaded mathematical operators so that algebra can
/// be written in a natural way.
///
/// The SQuIDs library has a limited ability to optimize away temporary objects.
/// That is, all operations of the forms
///     v1 [Op1]= v2 [Op2] v3;
///     v1 [Op1]= s * v2;
/// where v1, v2, and v3 are pre-existing objects of type SU_vector (and s is
/// a scalar) are performed without allocating memory. Op1 may +, -, or nothing
/// (normal assignment), and Op2 may be +, -, time evolution, a commutator or
/// an anticommutator.
///
/// This optimization is inhibited when v1 aliases v2 or v3 (they are the same
/// objects or they otherwise refer to the same backing storage).
/// This has no influence on the correctness of writing complex expressions in
/// terms of subexpressions: These will still be correctly evaluated, but memory
/// will be allocated for the results of the subexpressions, making the
/// calculation slower than if this can be avoided. It is expected that users
/// will write expressions in the form they find most natural, and only if
/// performance optimization is required consider restructuring code to take
/// deliberate advantage of this optimization. In that case, the following
/// techniques may be useful:
///
/// 1. If a calculation involving subexpressions is performed in a loop, it is
/// advantageous to manually create sufficient temporaries for all
/// subexpressions outside of the loop and then split the complex expression
/// into a series of basic operations whose results are stored to the
/// temporaries. This ensures that allocation will be performed only once per
/// temporary before entering the loop, rather than once per temporary, per
/// loop iteration. For example:
///
///     //assuming size N arrays of SU_vector state, v1, v2, v3, and v4,
///     //and a floating-point t
///     for(unsigned int i=0; i<N; i++)
///         state[i] += v1[i].SUEvolve(v2[i],t) + v3[i].SUEvolve(v4[i],t);
///
///    In this code the addition on the right hand side can be performed without
/// allocation, but each of the evolution operations must allocate a temporary,
/// so 2*N allocations and deallocations must occur. This can be reduced to 2
/// allocations and deallocations by rewriting in this form:
///
///     SU_vector temp1, temp2;
///     for(unsigned int i=0; i<N; i++){
///       temp1 = v1[i].SUEvolve(v2[i],t);
///       temp2 = v3[i].SUEvolve(v4[i],t)
///       state[i] += temp1 + temp2;
///     }
///
/// 2. If a calculation has an SU_vector calulation as a subexpression, but
/// otherwise operates on scalars it can be useful to rewite the expression so
/// that the vector calculation forms the top level if possible:
///
///     //assuming SU_vectors v1 and v2 and scalars s1 and s2
///     v1 = s1*(s2*v2);
///
///    can be better reassociated as:
///
///     v1 = (s1*s2)*v2;
///
/// Concerning alignment: Some SU_vector operations are more efficient when the
/// destination and operands' underlying storage has a particular alignment.
/// Specifically, for best performance even dimensioned SU_vectors should be 32
/// byte aligned, while odd dimensioned SU_vectors should have the second
/// component 32 byte aligned. SU_vector::make_aligned will automatically create
/// SU_vectors satisfying these criteria, as will the other static factory
/// functions.
